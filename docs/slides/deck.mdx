## Fresho

<Image

  src="images/fresho_logo_green.svg" />

<Notes>

* The way we work at Fresho
* 8 developers, full stack, full pipeline
    * No QA
    * No ops
* Devs do
    * Business analysis - 2am market visits
    * Solution design
    * Frontend, backend, infrastructure, test frameworks
* Pairing, trunk based development which is agile and iterative
* 100% test first
* Each piece of code is tested in 6 or 7 different ways before it’s written
* A well maintained automated test suite will ultimately save you time
* Manual tests DO NOT SCALE

# Test Driven Design

<Appear>

<div>

* Red, Green, Refactor

</div>
<div>

* Design a loosely-coupled solution

</div>
<div>

* Test code implementation of an isolated unit

</div>

</Appear>

<Notes>

* When people think of testing they often think of TDD
* Test Driven Development
* or (more correctly) Test Driven Design
* TDD often refers to test driving implementation of isolated units
    * Red Green Refactor
    * Write a test
    * See it fail
    * Write the simplest implementation to make the test pass
    * And iterate
* TDD is a great way to design simple, loosely coupled solutions at a detailed low level
* It’s all about the code implementation of single isolated units
* But the style of testing we’re primarily interested today in (you guessed it!) BDD - Behaviour Driven Design

</Notes>

# Behaviour Driven Design

<Appear>

<div>

* Enough is enough

</div>
<div>

* Deliver stakeholder value

</div>
<div>

* Test behaviour across many units

</div>

</Appear>

<Notes>

* In contrast, BDD is about testing behaviour, NOT implementation
* According to the RSpec book, there are 3 key principles of BDD
* Enough is enough
    * Working towards stakeholder expectations, we should avoid doing more than we need to
    * Build the minimum feature
    * Get feedback from users
    * Build according to their needs
* Deliver stakeholder value
    * There are multiple stakeholders - ie shareholders, product owner, also admins and users
    * Software should be about delivering demonstrable value to them.
* BDD is all about behavior across many units
    * The idea being that isolated units which are tested on their own you may have 100% code coverage
    * But if a number of those units are expected to work together, your isolated tests may not be enough.

Let’s take a look at a 100% unit tested, behavioural failure

<Notes>

* Can you see what’s going on here?
* A gate with a sensor, which seems to work correctly
* And a door with a sensor, which also seems to work correctly
* But where’s the person walking through the doors?!
* The problem here is that the two of these together don’t behave the way you would expect them to!

# Modules

1. The Unit Under Test
1. When Then Steps
1. Flows vs Mechanics
1. Add a Feature with Outside-In BDD

<Notes>

* Main focus of today is to get to module 4 Add a feature with outside in BDD
* The biggest takeaway is hopefully module 3 in how to scale large amounts of
  integration specs by splitting them into Flows and Mechanics
* To get there we need some tools which we will cover in module 1 and 2
* A quick look at the unit under test to understand our demo app and the role
  of tests 
* Followed by When Then steps to manage these tests

</Notes>

#  Module 1  

##  The Unit Under Test

* Frontend React
* Components
* Frontend lives as a client on the browser
* API/ Serializer
* Controller
* Model
* Database

# Testing boundaries

## Integration tests and the rest

# How does the app work?

## Open spec/features/monster_spec.rb

<Notes>

* go through the file in editor

</Notes>

# How does the app really work?

## Let’s take a look

<Notes>

* draw out the states of the app
* run the app and see it in dev mode on http://localhost:3000

</Notes>

# 1. The Unit under Test - Review

* Units under test
    * Frontend & backend together - Integration
    * Backend (API to DB) - Integration
    * Components - Isolated unit
* Read tests, understand how the system works

</Appear>

<Notes>

* GIVEN I have $100 balance in the bank
* WHEN I withdraw $70
* THEN I should have $30 left and $70 in my wallet
* These GIVEN WHEN THEN steps are a good way to describe and organise any test
    * It is a simple formula to follow
        * GIVEN - setup a known state
        * WHEN - perform a repeatable action
        * THEN - affirm an expected result
    * It is similar to the scientific method
    * It tests 1 thing at a time and all in 1 go, 1 shot for the action which happens in the “WHEN” step
What are the limitations?

* Given When Then gives you the ability to test 1 shot at a time
* Set everything up just right
* Do your thing
* And assert that everything you want to happen does
* But there are limitations …
* There may be so many actors and system changes in place that it can get quite complex.
* Also there is no clear narrative how you got to a particular state if it is
  all locked away in a Given step
* let’s take a look at an alternative

# From<br/>Given/When/Then<br/>To<br/>series of When/Then

<Notes>

* We are suggesting that GIVEN WHEN THEN gets changed to a series of WHEN THEN
  steps
* NOTE many people would say this is breaking the cardinal rule of BDD, they
  warn you against this!
* We believe that when multiple systems and actors are involved this series of
  WHEN THEN scenarios, is better and at documenting and testing how the system
  works.

More on how to scale these tests in the next module

</Notes>

---

# "When" "Then"<br/>flows through the system

<Notes>

* For the moment the series of WHEN THEN steps will take us on a core path
  through our system
* It should be the core business path
* The WHEN THEN narrative conveys this to developers

</Notes>

# 2. When Then steps - Review

* Integration specs
    * ‘When Then’ pair denotes behaviour
    * Multiple ‘When Then’ behaviours per scenario
    * Owned by developers
    * First code you write!
* `gem rspec-example_steps`

<Notes>

* Each When Then should denote a behaviour
* Multiple When and Then behaviours per scenario describe a larger part of your system.
* These integration feature specs are owned by developers, not business analysts or testers
* These integration feature specs should be the first piece of code we as developers write of a new application or a new feature. We will see this in an upcoming module
* This is a tool for us to better understand a test and modify it in future

# Module 3

## Flows vs Mechanics

---

# The problem

<Appear>
<div>

* Hundreds of scenarios

</div>
<div>

* Big unreadable files

</div>
<div>

* Deeply nested contexts

</div>
<div>

* Hard to find existing tests

</div>
</Appear>

<Notes>

* But the problem with just talking about integration specs is that you could
  come up with hundreds of scenarios to describe the expected behaviours of
  your system
* As you can imagine, needing so many tests can quickly lead to files that are
  1000’s of lines long 
* And tangled with deeply nested contexts
* Those files probably also have names which make it increasingly hard to find
  the tests you’re interested in modifying

So what can we do about it?

</Notes>

---

# A solution

<Appear>
<div>

* Separate different responsibilities

</div>
</Appear>

<Notes>

* A solution that Fresho’s CTO Perryn Fowler came up with and that we follow is
  to split these integration tests up according to what it is that they’re
  responsible for testing.
* At this level, we believe there are two main responsibilities of tests The
* first is what we like to refer to as Flows

</Notes>

---

# Flows

* Driven by external interface
* Particular sequence of events
* Effects of a series of interactions
* Multiple actors

<Notes>

* Test the entire system works together the ways it’s expected to.
* Primarily about the follow on effects of user and system interactions
* Dependant on a particular sequence of event taking place
* And typically involve multiple actors 

And the second, we refer to as Mechanics

</Notes>

---

# Mechanics

* Driven by partial interface
* Immediate behaviour of one unit
* Single actor
* No critical flow on effects 
* Exercise in more detail

<Notes>

* About testing the intricacies of individual pieces of functionality
* They determine the immediate behaviour of a single action
* This behaviour typically has no flow on effects
* Focussing in on a small part allows these behaviours to be exercised in more
  detail

</Notes>

---

# A solution

* Separate different responsibilities
* Organise tests
* Scale your test suite!

<Notes>

* Splitting integration tests by responsibility like this
* Helps us find tests in the future for modification 
* Helps us decide where to write new tests
* As a side effect, naming those test files becomes easier too, 
* Because their naming is more explicitly linked to the examples inside
* And most importantly, your test suite suddenly becomes scalable!

<BGImage src="images/marionette.jpg" />

<Notes>

* using a marionette as a metaphor
* the woden panel is our user interface and making the puppet walk is a flow as
  there are flow on effects of lifting 1 foot in that the other foot has to go
  down
* manipulating a single leg via the hip and string to the foot would be a
  mechanic to allow a leg to make a step
* manpulating the leg by itself would be a unit test

# 3. Flows vs Mechanics - Review

* Organise integration tests
* Document how system works
* Flows
    * Effects of a series of interactions
    * Multiple actors
* Mechanics
    * Immediate behaviour of one unit
    * Single actor

<Notes>

* Flows and Mechanics are all integration tests
* We split them up based on their responsibilities as a way to organise these
  tests
* Means examples are easier to find for future modification
* Clear way to document how the system behaves
* Flows 
* Test flow on effects of a series of user interactions
* Mechanics 
* Test immediate behaviours of a single action within the system
* Flows and Mechanics are another tool on top of When/Then steps that help
  organise our tests and describe intent which will help in building out a new
  feature in the next module
